#PROJECT: Basic PLOTS, CHARTS AND GRAPHS Application with R

Data visualization is the presentation of data with graphics. It's a way to summarize your findings and display it in a form that facilitates interpretation and can help in identifying patterns or trends. Having great data visualizations will make your work more interesting and clear. This project demonstrates the knowledge of importance of representation of data in the form of graphs, charts and plots. In this notebook you will learn how to create scatter plots, line plots, and box plots with ggplot2.
