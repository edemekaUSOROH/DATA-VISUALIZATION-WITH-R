# Data Visualization with R - Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating and customizing visualizations using R in Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates fundamental plotting techniques, applying various plots, and customizations to make the visualizations more informative and visually appealing. Additionally, the project includes mapping geographical data.

### Key Components:
1. **Basic Plots**: Introduction to basic plotting functions in R (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots).
2. **Applying Basic Plots**: Practical examples and applications of basic plots to visualize different data types.
3. **Plot Customizations**: Customizing visual elements such as colors, themes, labels, and annotations.
4. **Maps**: Visualizing geographical data using maps and adding custom layers.
